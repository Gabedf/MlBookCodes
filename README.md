# 📚 Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem — Code and Notes

Welcome to my repository dedicated to studying and practicing the concepts from the book **"Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem"** by **Abhishek Thakur**, a 4x Kaggle Grandmaster.

This repository contains code, notebooks, examples, and experiments based on the concepts covered in the book, with a strong focus on practical machine learning applications.
